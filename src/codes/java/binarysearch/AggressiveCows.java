//Farmer John has built a new long barn, with N stalls.
//Given an array of integers A of size N where each element of the array represents the location of the stall,
//and an integer B which represent the number of cows.
//
//His cows donâ€™t like this barn layout and become aggressive towards each other once put
//into a stall. To prevent the cows from hurting each other, John wants to assign the cows to the stalls,
//such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?
